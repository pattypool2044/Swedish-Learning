    <!--start intro--> 
<p><b>Introduction:</b>
 I live in Sweden just over 1 year and have tried to learn Swedish via one of the SFI schools and was not lucky in this. 
 Now I follow private lessons but if you get easily confused by the big grammatical words like me you when you get passed the A level you get headache
 and might tend to lose motivation. Another thing that I had an issue is with is that most Swedish lessons seems to be mostly setup for Restaurants, Stores, Healthcare,
 sport, and less about the daily life. While I will take this up in the lessons as well, I will alsp add more common daily conversations.
 In the beginning I was very motivated, could remember a lot of things and felt confident.
 Then I started mixed B and C materials and started with big words like "Konjunktioner", "Interjektioner", "Depones" and exceptions just when you think you understand the rule it gets destroyed. I got confused and drawing a blank each time I try to start a small conversation in Swedish. And lessons go from beginner to advance and back. It often skips several steps ahead to go back again. If you are like me, than this is site will be good for you.</p>

<p>The idea of this website is try to Create a more common daily Swedish and less technical Swedish, and for me hit 2 birds at once. Learning Swedish and practice my Coding. I am more a person that 
needs the practical more than the theoretical. So bear with me in creating this site and home if all goes well many can enjoy it.</p>
